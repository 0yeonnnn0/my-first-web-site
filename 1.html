        One way out is all you're ever going to get<br>
        From those who'll hand it out don't never let it upset you<br>
        'Cause they'll put words into your mouths<br>
        They're making you feel so ashamed<br>
        Making you taking the blame<br>
        Making you cold in the night<br>
        Making you question your heart and your soul<br>
        And I think that it's not quite right<br>
        Hey, stay young and invincible<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        And come what may we're unstoppable<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        Yeah we know just what we are<br>
        Yeah we know just what we are<br>
        Feed your head with all the things you need<br>
        When you're hungry<br>
        Stay in bed and sleep all day as long as it's Sunday<br>
        'Cause they'll put words into my mouth<br>
        They're making me feel so ashamed<br>
        Making me taking the blame<br>
        Making me cold in the night<br>
        Making me question my heart and my soul<br>
        And I think that it's not quite right<br>
        Hey, stay young and invincible<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        And come what may we're unstoppable<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        Yeah we know just what we are<br>
        Yeah we know just what we are<br>
        Hey, stay young and invincible<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        And come what may we're unstoppable<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        And hey, stay young and invincible<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        And come what may my faith's unshakeable<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        'Cause we know just what we are<br>
        Know just what we are<br>
        Know just what we are<br>
        Know just what we are<br>
        Know just what we are</p>
