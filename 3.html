        Slip inside the eye of your mind<br>
        Don't you know you might find<br>
        A better place to play<br>
        You said that you'd never been<br>
        But all the things that you've seen<br>
        Slowly fade away<br><br>

        So I start a revolution from my bed<br>
        'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head<br>
        Step outside, summertime's in bloom<br>
        Stand up beside the fireplace<br>
        Take that look from off your face<br>
        You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out<br><br>

        And so Sally can wait<br>
        She knows it's too late<br>
        As we're walking on by<br>
        Her soul slides away<br>
        But don't look back in anger<br>
        I heard you say<br><br>

        Take me to the place where you go<br>
        Where nobody knows<br>
        If it's night or day<br>
        But please don't put your life in the hands<br>
        Of a rock and roll band<br>
        Who'll throw it all away<br><br>

        I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed<br>
        'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head<br>
        Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom<br>
        Stand up beside the fireplace<br>
        Take that look from off your face<br>
        'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out<br><br>

        And so Sally can wait<br>
        She knows it's too late<br>
        As she's walking on by<br>
        My soul slides away<br>
        But don't look back in anger<br>
        I heard you say<br><br>

        So Sally can wait<br>
        She knows it's too late<br>

        My soul slides away<br>
        But don't look back in anger<br>
        Don't look back in anger<br>
        I heard you say<br>
        At least not today
